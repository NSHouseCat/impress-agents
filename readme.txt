Employee Directory tailored for Real Estate Offices.

== Description ==

IMPress Agents provides you with a full employee directory, that is ideal for Real Estate teams and offices.

This plugin adds a custom post type for Employees with post meta fields for contact info. It uses included templates to display the contact info for single and archive pages, or these can be overridden in your theme.

Adds taxonomies for Offices and Job Types to show employees by location and/or job title. Or add custom taxonomies to categorize to your needs. If using WP 4.4+, you can add images to taxonomy terms and display an image for an office, job title, or a custom taxonomy term.

If using the [IMPress Listings](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-listings/) plugin, you can connect Employees to Listings. *Requires the [Posts 2 Posts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/posts-to-posts/) plugin*
